Have you become too dependent on Generative AI to do your work? Do you need something cute to guilt-trip you out of using it?

Introducing insert-name!

## 🌍 The Problem
- People see chatGPT and other LLMs as inconsequential, magical wizards. Especially among students like us, there is a normalized overreliance on them
- Each ChatGPT search emits 10 times as much as a Google search. Thats...
    - 2.9 Wh of energy
    - 4.3 grams of CO2
    - 500 ml of water
- We want people to use AI only when they really need it

## 🦆 The Solution
- We want to break the AI-induced trance that many students are in and show that it’s not inconsequential 
- We’ve created a cute extension that monitors your LLM queries and tells you how much environmental damage you’ve caused per search 
- Our extension calculates and displays equivalent hard-hitting impacts in terms of wasted energy, carbon, and water

# ⭐ The Future
We see our app being:
- Downloaded by school computers
- Built into commercial LLMs
- Raising awareness about more efficient energy use
